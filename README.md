# NFLHomevsAwayResults
# This project is looking to gain an insight on whether or not home teams are favored by the sportsbooks. In other words, how many points of the spread are added simply because they are the home team. 
# There are currently two files in the project, one that webscrapes the website, and the other that calls the function, collects the data and analyzes the numbers.
# As of now, the project is simply looking at the record for home teams across the last five seasons against the spread
